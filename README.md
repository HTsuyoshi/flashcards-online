# Flashcards

Flashcards is a simple project made in `vuejs` and hosted using `Amazon S3`.

The client send requests to [kanjiapi](https://kanjiapi.dev/) to retrieve lists of kanjis, kanji meaning and kanji readings.

The goal of this project is to create a web version of my application `flashcards-cli` that can be found [here](https://github.com/HTsuyoshi/flashcards-cli).

### Preview

Try the application in the following [link](https://playground.htsuyoshiy.online/flashcards/) :D
